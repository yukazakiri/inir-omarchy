# Autostart and Session

How iNiR starts, how apps autostart, and how sessions end.

## Shell startup

iNiR is started by the session supervisor selected for the current machine. On
a normal Arch/systemd-user session that is `inir.service`; on the supported
Void runit path it is a Turnstile-managed user service or the guarded runsvdir
fallback. The goal is the same in every tier: exactly one shell, tied to the
Niri session, with the compositor's authoritative environment and crash
recovery owned by a supervisor.

On the systemd tier, the service connects to the compositor via a wants link:

```
~/.config/systemd/user/niri.service.wants/inir.service
```

When Niri starts, `inir.service` waits for the `Type=notify` compositor service to report ready, so it inherits Niri's authoritative `DISPLAY`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` and `NIRI_SOCKET`. When Niri stops, iNiR stops. Manage the link with:

```bash
inir service enable     # create wants link
inir service disable    # remove it
inir service status     # check state
```

On Void without a usable systemd user manager, setup renders
`~/.config/service/inir/run`. Turnstile provides the user-session lifecycle and
environment directory when available; otherwise Niri owns a single runsvdir
fallback. Do not add a second handwritten `spawn-at-startup` shell entry on top
of that. `inir restart`, `inir logs`, `inir doctor` and the other normal CLI
operations select the active supervisor for you.

For the full boot sequence, see [Runtime and Boot Pipeline](RUNTIME.md).

## App autostart

There are two layers of autostart in a typical iNiR setup:

### Compositor level (spawn-at-startup)

These are defined in `~/.config/niri/config.d/50-startup.kdl` and managed by the compositor:

- `wl-paste --no-newline --type text --watch ~/.config/quickshell/inir/scripts/clipboard-store.py` (clipboard text history; avoids synthetic trailing newlines and strips browser markup)
- `wl-paste --type image --watch ~/.config/quickshell/inir/scripts/clipboard-image-store.sh` (clipboard image history; internal preview frames are filtered)
- `kbuildsycoca6` (KDE desktop entry cache)

These run before iNiR starts and are independent of the shell.

### Shell level (Autostart service)

iNiR has its own autostart manager that handles:

- **Desktop entries**: standard `.desktop` files in `~/.config/autostart/`
- **Custom commands**: user-defined commands configured through Settings
- **Systemd units**: user-level systemd services when that user manager exists

Manage autostart entries from Settings > System > Autostart (there is no CLI for this, it is managed through the settings UI, backed by `services/Autostart.qml`).

## Lock screen

The lock screen uses Wayland's session lock protocol (WlSessionLock). This is a security protocol: when active, all other surfaces are hidden and only the lock surface is visible. There's no way to bypass it by switching workspaces or killing processes.

### Authentication

- **Password**: PAM authentication (same as your login password)
- **Fingerprint**: supported if your system has fprintd configured

### Fallback

If the QML lock surface fails to render within 2 seconds, iNiR falls back to swaylock or hyprlock (whichever is installed). This prevents the session from being locked with no visible unlock UI.

### IPC

```bash
inir lock activate     # lock the session
inir lock deactivate   # unlock (requires auth)
inir lock status       # check lock state
```

### Config

Lock settings are in Settings > System > Lock:
- Blur background (on/off)
- Auto-lock on startup
- Unlock GNOME Keyring after authentication

## Session screen

The session screen provides logout, reboot, shutdown, and suspend actions. Access it from:
- Keybind (configurable)
- Power button in the bar/taskbar
- IPC: `inir session open`

Before executing an action, the session screen checks for running package managers and active downloads. If found, it warns you before proceeding.

## Polkit agent

iNiR is your PolicyKit authentication agent. When a privileged operation needs authorization (installing a package, mounting a disk), its dialog asks for your password, in the look of the family you use. Niri starts no other agent.

If you run an agent of your own, iNiR sees it at start and steps aside. Turn the shell's agent off with `QS_DISABLE_POLKIT=1`.

While the shell is restarting, nothing answers graphical prompts and they fail as not authorized; try again once it is back (systemd restarts it on its own). `pkexec` and `run0` in a terminal ask there instead.

On the supported Void Turnstile tier the shell starts with `QS_DISABLE_POLKIT=1`.
Turnstile's per-user service manager belongs to an elogind background session, so
a Quickshell listener registered from that service is not the same subject as the
seat0 graphical session and polkit rejects it. Because the shell runs outside the
session there, Niri starts `polkit-gnome` (installed by the Void dependency
profile) from the Turnstile block of the startup file; setup writes that line only
for this tier and removes it if the tier changes. The systemd and runsvdir tiers
run the shell inside the session, where it stays the only agent.

## Idle management

Idle timeouts are handled by swayidle, configured through Settings or IPC:

- **Screen off**: turn off monitors after inactivity (default: 5 minutes)
- **Lock**: lock the session after inactivity (default: 10 minutes)
- **Suspend**: suspend the system after inactivity (default: off)

Idle timeouts are configured in Settings (backed by `services/Idle.qml`); there is no `inir idle` CLI command.

Fullscreen video players and presentations automatically inhibit idle via the idle-inhibit Wayland protocol.
