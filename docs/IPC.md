# IPC Reference

iNiR exposes IPC targets you can call from Niri keybinds, scripts, or your terminal.

> **Quick discovery:** `inir help` lists all targets, `inir <target> --help` shows available functions.
> Tab completion knows every target, function and the values each one takes: `inir completions install`.

From terminal (for testing, or showing off):

```bash
inir <target> <function> [values…]
```

As a Niri keybind, let `inir bind` write it for you. It checks the call, tells you if the keys already do something, and saves the bind to your own block in `~/.config/niri/config.d/90-user-extra.kdl`:

```bash
inir bind Mod+O orbit toggle          # shows the line and what those keys do now
inir bind --add Mod+O orbit toggle    # saves it; Niri picks it up right away
inir bind --examples                  # ready binds for your panel family
inir bind --list                      # the binds you added
inir bind --remove Mod+O
```

Or by hand, as a line inside the `binds { }` block of your Niri config:

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+O repeat=false { spawn "inir" "orbit" "toggle"; }
}
```

The examples below are lines for that block.

For low-level debugging, `inir ipc <target> <function>` still works.

## Available Targets

Everything iNiR can do, exposed for your scripting pleasure.

### dev

Development navigation for loading lazy surfaces and internal views without
automating pointer or keyboard input. Destination identifiers are stable and
returned as JSON by `list`.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `list` | Return the destination inventory as JSON |
| `open` | Open a destination by semantic identifier |
| `close` | Close development-opened surfaces and clear the request |
| `current` | Return the current destination or `closed` |
| `reload` | Reload the shell's QML the way an edit does (soft: windows are kept). In a git checkout `scripts/daemon/dev_hot_reload.py` calls it for the files Quickshell does not watch itself |
| `meter` | Measure frame gaps for the given milliseconds (250–20000, default 2500) |
| `metered` | Return the last measurement as JSON: frames, mean, p95, worst, frames over 20 and 50 ms |
| `dragSim` | Simulate carrying an iRiS bubble (slot id, default `extra-clock`) around the focused output for 2.5 s, publishing the given number of moves per frame (1–16); never writes the config |

```bash
inir dev list | jq -r '.[].id'
inir dev open sidebar-left/anime-schedule
inir dev close
inir dev audit
inir dev audit sidebar-left/ai settings/ai
inir dev audit --all --all-families
inir dev meter 2500; sleep 3; inir dev metered
inir dev dragSim extra-clock 8; inir dev meter 2400; sleep 3; inir dev metered
```

`inir dev audit` selects destinations related to changed area-specific files in
the current worktree. Destination arguments select an exact scope, while
`--all` requests every safe destination and `--all-families` includes both ii
and waffle. Each visited destination is closed again and new QML warnings or
errors are attributed to the destination that triggered them. Destructive
actions such as locking, recording, power commands, and wallpaper mutation are
excluded.

with a marked block at the end of `~/.config/niri/config.d/90-user-extra.kdl`; `opens niri` removes that block.
Your own binds are left as they are. The same choice is in Settings, next to the switcher's options.

Short notices when something is plugged in, connected, unplugged or lost: networks, the internet, Bluetooth devices, USB devices by name (mice, keyboards, controllers, cameras, phones), the charger, the sound output, displays, and drives and memory cards with their name and size. Each family shows them its own way: a pill under the bar in Material, a panel in Waffle, the Island in iRiS. Settings has a switch for each kind.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `sample <kind>` | Show how a notice looks without plugging anything: `network`, `internet`, `bluetooth`, `usb`, `power`, `audio`, `displays` or `drives` |
| `status` | Print which kinds are on as JSON, and whether udev is there to watch USB devices and drives |
| `enable` / `disable` / `toggle` | Turn connection notices on or off |

---

### bluetooth

The Bluetooth adapter as every family shows it. `simulate` lets you see the Bluetooth surfaces without the hardware.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `status` | Print `on`, `off`, `no adapter` or how many devices are connected, marked `(simulated)` while simulating |
| `simulate <state>` | Pretend the adapter is `off`, `on`, has a number of connected devices (`2`) or is missing (`none`) until `clear` or a restart. For testing |

---

### battery

The laptop battery as every family shows it. `simulate` lets you see the battery surfaces on a machine without one.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `status` | Print the level and whether it is charging, discharging or plugged in, marked `(simulated)` while simulating |
| `simulate <spec>` | Pretend the battery is at a level and state until the shell restarts: `14`, `"14 charging"`, `full` or `off`. Never suspends the machine. For testing |

---

### network

Whether the shell can reach the internet, as NetworkManager sees it. Surfaces that show online content (wallpaper sources, news, anime, weather, calendars, lyrics) read this to say why they are empty instead of failing quietly.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `status` | Print the state as JSON: `online`, `connectivity` (`full`, `limited`, `portal`, `none`, `unknown`), connection name |
| `check` | Ask NetworkManager to check connectivity again, for example after signing in to a captive portal |
| `simulate <state>` | Pretend the connectivity is `none`, `limited`, `portal` or `full` until the shell restarts; any other value clears it. For testing |
| `simulateLink <spec>` | Pretend the link is `"wifi 40"` (a signal strength), `searching`, `connecting`, `"radio off"`, `ethernet` or `none` (no adapter) until `off` or a restart. For testing |

---

### vpn

NetworkManager VPN profiles (OpenVPN, WireGuard, anything with an NM plugin) and Tailscale, as the VPN piece and its card show them.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `status` | Print the state as JSON: connected, through what, Tailscale's state, its devices and how many are online, your profiles |
| `toggle` | Turn every active VPN off, or connect Tailscale (else your first profile) when none is on |
| `details <state>` | `on`, `off` or `toggle` the card's details: addresses, name, account, exit node, devices and live traffic |
| `refresh` | Read profiles and Tailscale again |
| `importFile <path>` | Add a WireGuard `.conf` or OpenVPN `.ovpn` file as a NetworkManager profile; with no path, open the file chooser (*Import a file…* in the card) |
| `add <kind>` | Create a VPN in NetworkManager's connection editor: `wireguard`, or `vpn` for the installed plugins (OpenVPN, L2TP…); `nmtui` in your terminal when the editor is not installed |

```kdl
Super+Alt+V { spawn "inir" "vpn" "toggle"; }
```

---

### niriAnimations

Presets for Niri's own window, workspace and overview animations. Applying one rewrites the animations in `config.d/60-animations.kdl` and keeps `off` and `slowdown` as they were. The same picker lives in Settings in every family. Your own presets go in `~/.config/inir/niri-animation-presets.json` as `{"presets": [...]}`, in the same shape as `defaults/niri-animation-presets.json`; one with a shipped id replaces it.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `list` | List the presets; `*` marks the one your config matches |
| `active` | Print the preset your config matches, or `custom` after hand edits |
| `apply <id>` | Apply a preset: `snappy`, `niri`, `material`, `bouncy`, `gentle`, `instant` or one of yours |

|----------|-------------|
| `open` | Expand the island on the focused output |
| `close` | Collapse the island |

It also takes `next`, `prev`, `back`, `forward` (the history), `search:<words>` and `open` (the first result) |
| `bubble` | Place an Island bubble (`left`, `right`, `utility`) or an extra bubble (`weather`, `notifications`, `controls`, `sound`, `mic`, `tools`, `media`, `visualizer`, `tray`): a zone (`top-left`, `top-right`, `left`, `right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right`), `edge:<top|bottom|left|right>` with an optional `:<fraction>` along that edge (e.g. `edge:top:0.3`), `x,y` fractions of the output, `island` (slots) or `off` (extras) |
| `dock` | `reveal`, `hide` or `toggle` the iRiS Dock (revealed stays until hidden or an app is chosen) |

| `motioned` | The last `motion` measurement as JSON: frame pace, continuity, material, one surface, origin and a clean end, each passed or not, with the numbers behind them |
| `edit` | Customize iRiS on the shell itself: the Island grows a capsule (Themes, Look, Pieces, undo, Done) and whatever you click (a piece, the Island, the Dock) grows its own options: `on`, `off`, `toggle`, a sheet (`themes`, `pieces`, or a Look tab: `material`, `colour`, `type`, `motion`, `bodies`, `places`, `transients`, `desktop`), `island`, `dock` or a piece to inspect (`vitals`, `left`, `app:kitty`) |
| `control` | Arrange the Control Center in place (drag controls, resize them from a corner, add or take them out): `edit`, `done`, `toggle`, `undo`, `tab:<controls\|layouts\|panel>` to open the side library on that page, `expand:<display\|system\|devices\|network\|bluetooth\|none>` to open the Control Center with that expansion unfolded, or a layout (`iris`, `discs`, `compact`, `glance`, `studio`, `everything`) |

| `strip` | What the menu bar lays under its items: `transparent` (on the wallpaper) or `band` |
| `edge` | Move the Island to a screen edge: `top`, `bottom`, `left` or `right` (on a side edge it rests as an upright capsule and its pages grow inward) |
| `dockEdge` | Move the Dock: `auto` (opposite the Island), `top`, `bottom`, `left` or `right` |
| `zone` | What a full-width Island carries in a zone: `start`, `center` or `end`, then kinds joined by `+` (`island`, `workspaces`, `window`, `time` or a piece kind), or `none` |
| `preset` | Set the iRiS appearance preset: `iris`, `soft`, `round`, `crisp`, `angular` or `contrast` |
| `palette` | The colour theme the shell and your apps wear: an id such as `catppuccin-mocha` or `iris-ink`, `auto` to follow the wallpaper, `list` for the ones iRiS shows, or `current` for the one in use |
| `theme <action>` | iRiS themes, each a whole redesign of the family: `list`, `apply:<id>`, `save:<name>` (what you see now becomes a theme file), `import:<path>` (a shared `.json`), `export` or `export:<id>` (prints the theme as JSON to share) and `folder` (where theme files live, `~/.config/inir/iris/themes`) |
| `morph` | Set how iRiS morphs: `direct`, `liquid`, `glide`, `snap`, `elastic` or `instant` |
| `set` | Set any iRiS option by path, e.g. `iris.appearance.theme.pieceShape squircle` or `iris.bubbles.scale 120` (values are JSON when they parse) |
| `adaptive` | How much the wallpaper shapes iRiS, `0`-`100`; any other word prints what was read from the wallpaper |
| `tokens` | JSON with the colours iRiS resolved for the current look and the contrast of each text, accent and fill on the surface it sits on (worst case over glass), plus the ones below their target |
| `spotlight` | Open Spotlight with a query already typed, e.g. `firefox` or `12*7` (empty for suggestions); while it is open, replaces the query |
| `spotlightClose` | Close Spotlight |
| `orbit` | Open Orbit with a search already typed, e.g. `firefox` (empty for all the workspaces) |

| `orbitCorner` | The corner each output's Orbit hot corner is on right now, as JSON (empty where Niri's own corner or the setting leaves none) |
| `gallerySource` | Show or hide an online source in the wallpaper gallery: `wallhaven`, `live`, `konachan` or `yandere`, then `on`, `off` or `toggle`; returns the sources shown, in order |
| `bubbleCard` | Grow a bubble's own card: `weather`, `notifications`, `sound`, `mic`, `tools` or `tray` (from the bubble showing it, else the Island), or `close` |
| `tap` | Tap a piece the Island carries (`controls`, `sound`, `tray`, `notifications`, `weather`…) as a click would: its card or page grows from it, or says the focused screen's bar has no such piece |
| `bubbleMenu` | Open a floating bubble's own menu — what it opens, where it rests and how to put it away — by kind (`weather`, `sound`, …) or piece id (`app:kitty`) |
| `icon <piece> <glyph>` | Choose the glyph a piece wears: `controls`, `tools`, `focus`, `notifications`, `bluetooth`, `updates`, `anime` or `watching`, then a Material Symbol name (e.g. `inir iris icon controls settings`) or `reset` to go back to its own face |
| `utility` | Set the utility satellite: `tray`, `tools`, `sound`, `mic` or `none` |
| `desktopMenu <x> <y>` | Open the desktop menu on the focused output at that point, in pixels; no point opens it in the middle |

| `menuClose` | Close whichever iRiS or shell context menu is open |
| `watch` | What the Continue bubble has in progress, or resume one of them: no argument lists them numbered with the episode and saved position, a number or part of a title resumes that show. Anything that matches nothing in progress starts a search instead. Only ani-cli can be pointed at one show; jerry and curd run their own picker |
| `watchPick` | Answer whatever the Continue bubble is asking (which show, which episode, what next once one ends, which quality): no argument lists the options, a number or part of a label chooses one, `cancel` stops the run |
| `watchSkip` | Close the episode that is playing and start the `next` (default) or `previous` one without searching again. Its place is saved first |
| `watchSubs` | Subtitles of the episode that is playing: `size+`, `size-` (kept for every episode), `delay+`, `delay-`, `delay0` (this episode), `off`, `track:<id>`, `file:<path>` to load one. No argument lists the tracks |
| `watchSeek` | Jump inside the episode that is playing by seconds: `85` skips an opening, `-10` goes back |
| `status` | JSON with the Island, Dock, Control Center, Spotlight and side panel state, which edit modes, Settings or the wallpaper gallery hold the screen (`editing`, `settings`, `gallery`), plus the player the Island follows (title, position, length) |

```bash
inir iris open

### autostart

Niri login autostart manager. Reads and writes the managed section of
`~/.config/niri/config.d/50-startup.kdl` (delimited by `// >>> inir-managed-autostart >>>` /
`// <<< inir-managed-autostart <<<`). Base iNiR lines and any hand-written
`spawn-at-startup` lines outside the markers are preserved verbatim; toggling an
entry comments the line out instead of deleting it. Safe no-op on non-Niri
compositors (the page shows a guard instead).

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `status` | Return `niri\|<path>\|<managedCount>\|<externalCount>\|<state>` |
| `addApp <desktopId>` | Append a managed `gtk-launch <desktopId>` entry |
| `addCommand <cmd>` | Append a managed `spawn-sh-at-startup` shell line |
| `removeLast` | Remove the last managed entry |
| `reload` | Force re-read the startup file |

The Settings UI (ii: AutostartConfig, waffle: WAutostartPage) is the primary
interface; these IPC calls exist for scripts/keybinds. Apps the user already
launches via hand-written lines outside the markers are detected and shown as
"External" (read-only) in the list.

## Standalone Commands

These are top-level `inir` commands that work directly, without going through IPC.

### colorpicker

Launch `hyprpicker` to pick a color from anywhere on the screen. The hex value is copied to the clipboard (`-a` flag).

```kdl
Super+Shift+C { spawn "inir" "colorpicker"; }
```

Requires `hyprpicker` installed.
