# iNiR

A complete desktop shell for Niri, built with Quickshell and QML.

It provides the bar, dock, sidebars, notifications, settings, wallpapers, overview, lock screen, IPC and theming in one shell. Niri is the supported and tested compositor; legacy Hyprland compatibility paths remain from the original fork.

## Branches

`main` is the stable branch used by installations and updates.

`prerelease` is where development happens. It may be ahead by a lot. That is the point.

## Runtime shape

```text
Niri
  -> Quickshell
  -> shell.qml
  -> shared config and services
  -> ii, Waffle, or iRiS
  -> panels, overlays and widgets
```

The shell is configurable through Settings and `config.json`. Persistent writes go through the config service; editing QML is not part of normal use.

If the wiki disagrees with the current shell, the shell wins. Then the wiki gets fixed.
